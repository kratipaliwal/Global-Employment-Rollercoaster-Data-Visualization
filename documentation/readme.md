# Global Employment Rollercoaster: Navigating Economic Events and Unemployment Trends

## Abstract
This project explores the intricate dynamics between socioeconomic events and unemployment rates across various demographic groups, emphasizing age and gender differences. Using data visualization techniques, the analysis reveals the differential impacts of historical economic crises—like the Dotcom Bubble, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic—on employment. These visualizations provide critical insights for policymakers, economic analysts, and social planners.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze how economic events differentially impact various demographics (age and gender) in the workforce. By visualizing unemployment rates across three age groups and two genders over time, we aim to:
- Identify patterns and trends in unemployment during key economic events.
- Reveal the demographic groups most vulnerable to unemployment spikes.
- Provide actionable insights for addressing demographic-specific employment needs.

## Key Features
1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Area charts, line charts, scatter plots, and treemaps.
   - Focus on gender and age-wise unemployment trends during major economic events.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - Significant gender disparities during the Dotcom Bubble and Great Recession.
   - Age is a larger determinant of unemployment trends than gender.
   - Younger age groups face increasing unemployment challenges due to market shifts.

3. **Design Process**:
   - Multi-stage analysis using Tableau.
   - Storyboard-driven approach to visual storytelling.

4. **Future Directions**:
   - Expanding analysis to include variables like education, race, and industry sector.
   - Employing machine learning techniques for deeper insights.

## Dataset
- Data spans multiple countries and decades, covering significant economic events.
- Key variables:
  - **Demographics**: Age and gender.
  - **Unemployment Metrics**: Percentages over time.
  - **Economic Events**: Historical markers (e.g., Dotcom Bubble, COVID-19).
  
**Limitations**:
- Null values and inconsistent data sources posed challenges for cross-comparisons.

## Visualizations
### 1. **Global Trends by Gender and Age**:
   - Area chart highlighting unemployment spikes during events like the Great Recession.
   - Gender disparities and age-wise breakdowns.

### 2. **Country-Specific Resilience**:
   - Treemaps and line charts analyzing unemployment fluctuations for major countries.
   - Comparative resilience of North America and Europe to economic events.

### 3. **Dotcom Bubble Impact**:
   - Line charts focusing on regional unemployment trends in North America and Central Asia.

## Limitations & Further Work
- **Current Limitations**:
  - Limited scope (age and gender).
  - Data gaps due to missing values.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Incorporate more variables (education, industry).
  - Develop a Global Resilience Index.
  - Utilize machine learning for anomaly detection and clustering.
